## Play

By hovering over this and selecting `Play Project` you will initialize the `pnpm i` command. After this is done, Studio will run `npm run dev` command
and your project will be available on browser localhost and on the preview panel. You can also dock this panel wherever you want.

## Build

When you press the **Build** button, the system will first generate the necessary assets, then simultaneously build both the project and its associated buckets. Once the build process is complete, youâ€™ll be able to upload your game directly to the **Gearbox** platform.

#### Additional Options:

* **Analyzer**: 
  Enable this option to display the **Build Analyzer** if your game size is too large. It helps identify which assets or components are consuming the most space.

* **Hide Consoles**:
  Suppresses all `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` outputs during the build process for a cleaner output.

* **iOS and Android Links**:
  Default store URLs for iOS and Android can be configured here. These are adjustable on the **Gearbox** platform, but you can define default values in this panel.
