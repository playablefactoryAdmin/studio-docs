## Play

By hovering over this and selecting `Play Project` you will initialize the `pnpm i` command. After this is done, Studio will run `npm run dev` command
and your project will be available on browser localhost and on the preview panel. You can also dock this panel wherever you want.

## Build

When you press the **Build** button, the system will first generate the necessary assets, then simultaneously build both the project and its associated buckets. 
Once the build process is complete, youâ€™ll be able to upload your game directly to the platform.

#### Additional Options:

* **Analyzer**: 
  Enable this option to display the **Build Analyzer** if your game size is too large. It helps identify which assets or components are consuming the most space.

* **Hide Consoles**:
  Suppresses all `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` outputs during the build process for a cleaner output.

* **iOS and Android Links**:
  Default store URLs for iOS and Android can be configured here. These are adjustable on the platform, but you can define default values in this panel.

## Upload

When you press the **Upload** button, there will be a pop-up asking you to fill out some data. These should be very straight-forward.
After that is done, simply click on the **Upload** button higlighted in blue and your game will be uploaded to the platform. 

## Store

When you press the **Store** button, a new window will appear showing you the available Store items you can use.

In this example, we will use the 3d-test asset. Simply click on it:

<Image src="/studio-docs/basics/toolbox/store-intro.png" alt="build settings" width={700} height={300} className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden" />

After clicking on it, you will see an another pop-up:

<Image src="/studio-docs/basics/toolbox/store-import.png" alt="build settings" width={300} height={300} className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden" />

In the `Select a project` dropdown, select the project you want to import this in to, and then click Download.
