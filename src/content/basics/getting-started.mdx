# Getting Started

Welcome to Studio! This guide will help you get started with the Studio game development engine.

## System Requirements

Before installing Studio, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### Required
- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend using the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
  
  **Important**: After installation, ensure that npm is added to your system PATH. This is particularly important for Mac users, as npm is not automatically added to the PATH on macOS. You can verify this by opening a terminal and running `npm --version`. If the command is not found, you'll need to add npm to your PATH manually or restart your terminal.

### Optional (Recommended)
- **pnpm**: For faster package installations and builds, consider installing pnpm. You can install it globally using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

## Download and Installation

Download the latest release from the official website:

https://home.playablefactory.com/

After downloading, install the application and launch it.

## First Login

When you first open Studio, you'll need to log in with your Playable Factory account credentials.

Enter your Playable Factory email and password to access the Studio interface.

## Creating Your First Project

Once logged in, you'll see the Studio home page with several options for creating or opening projects.

### Project Options

#### 1. Import Project
Use this option to import an existing Studio project from your local file system. Once imported, the project will appear in your project list.

#### 2. New Project
Create a brand new project from scratch. You can choose between:
- **2D Project**: For 2D games and playable ads
- **3D Project**: For 3D games and experiences

Select your preferred project type, choose a location on your computer, and click "Create and Open".

#### 3. Project List
View all your recently worked on projects. You can:
- Click on any project to open it
- Remove projects from the list using the three-dot menu (this only removes them from the list, not from your computer)

### Project Menu

The project menu provides quick access to:
- **Import Project**: Import existing projects
- **Open From Gitlab**: Import projects from GitLab (if applicable)
- **New Project**: Create new projects
- **Recent Projects**: Access your recently worked on projects

## Quick Start Guide

After creating or opening a project, you'll be taken to the main Studio interface. Here's what you'll see:

### Main Interface Components

1. **Hierarchy Panel**: View and organize all objects in your scene
2. **View Panel**: Preview your game in real-time
3. **Inspector**: Modify properties of selected objects
4. **Toolbar**: Access main functions like play, build, and upload
5. **Asset Viewer**: Manage your project's assets

### Your First Steps

1. **Explore the Interface**: Familiarize yourself with the different panels and their functions
2. **Create Objects**: Use the hierarchy panel to add basic objects to your scene
3. **Preview Your Work**: Use the play button to test your project
4. **Build and Upload**: When ready, build your project and upload it to the platform
