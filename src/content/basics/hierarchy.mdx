# Hierarchy

import Image from "next/image";

The hierarchy allows you to view and edit the scene and all objects within it.

## Basics

### Scene Configuration

You can change your scene configuration by clicking on the object indicated by the scene icon at the top of the hierarchy.

### Create & Paste

You can create core or advanced objects by clicking the "+" button on top or right-clicking on an empty area of the hierarchy. Right-clicking on an empty area also allows you to paste previously copied objects.

## Editing Objects

Editing any object within the hierarchy is quite simple. 

### Selection

You can left-click on objects and select them. You can also select multiple objects simultaneously by holding down the Ctrl button. 

### Drag & Drop

You can drag objects to different locations within the hierarchy or insert them under different objects.

### Context Menu

After right-clicking on objects, you can copy the object, rename it, delete it, and perform some other functions using simplified features (Wrap Node, Create Prefab, Create Script).

From the panel at the top of the hierarchy, you can compress the entire tree view, lock all objects, or enable or disable the "sticky scroll" function.
