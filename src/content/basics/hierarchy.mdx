# Hierarchy

import Image from "next/image";

The hierarchy allows you to view and edit the scene and all objects within it.

## Basics

### Scene Configuration

You can change your scene configuration by clicking on the object indicated by the scene icon at the top of the hierarchy. 

### Create & Paste

You can create core or advanced objects by right-clicking on an empty area of the hierarchy. It also allows you to paste previously copied objects. 

## Editing Objects

Editing any object within the hierarchy is quite simple. 

### Selection

You can left-click on objects and select them. You can also select multiple objects simultaneously by holding down the Ctrl button. 

### Drag & Drop

You can drag objects to different locations within the hierarchy or insert them under different objects. 

### Context Menu

After right-clicking on objects, you can copy the object, rename it, delete it, and perform some other functions using simplified features (Wrap Node, Create Prefab, Create Script). 

#### Insert Child Nodes

If it is possible to insert new objects under objects, you can do so. 

### Visibility & Lock

You can change the appearance of objects or lock them by clicking the eye and lock icons next to them. 

## Top Panel

### Tree Controls 

From the panel at the top of the hierarchy, you can compress the entire tree view, lock all objects, or enable or disable the "sticky scroll" function. 

### Filter Search

You can use the "filter" text box at the top of the hierarchy to find the objects you are looking for by name.
