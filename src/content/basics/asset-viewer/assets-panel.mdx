## Create Script

You can create a ready-made script for your project by clicking the **+** icon in the Asset panel. From the dropdown menu that appears, select `Add 3D Script` for your 3D project or `Add 2D Script` for your 2D project.

If you prefer, you can choose the TypeScript format instead of JavaScript by using the `Add Script` buttons labeled with **(ts)**.

The script file you create is automatically added to the `@assets/scripts` directory. You can then view the script using the Asset panel.
