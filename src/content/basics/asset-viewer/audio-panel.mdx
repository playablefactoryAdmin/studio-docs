<Callout type="warning">
  Studio automatically imports all of the audio assets in the project. Delete
  all the unused audios to prevent unnecessary file size!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  To use a music as background music name it one of the followings: bgMusic,
  music, bgm, backgroundMusic. Studio will automatically treat this audio as the
  background music.
</Callout>

## Usage

To play an imported sound use:

```js
// enter the name of the sound without the extension
AudioManager.playSound("soundName");
```

This will play the audio whether it is an audiosprite or normal sound. It will find the audio with the name, if there is multiple audios with the same name it can lead to unwanted results.

#### playSound

```ts
static playSound(id: string, loop: boolean | undefined = undefined, volume: number | undefined = undefined, rate: number = 1): void
```

Play a sound with specified parameters including loop behavior, volume level, and playback rate.

<InnerHeader title="Parameters" />

<UserTable
  data={[
    {
      name: "id",
      desc: "Unique identifier of the sound to play.",
    },
    {
      name: "loop",
      desc: "Optional. Whether the sound should loop continuously. Defaults to undefined (no loop).",
    },
    {
      name: "volume",
      desc: "Optional. Volume level for the sound (0.0 to 1.0). Defaults to undefined (uses default volume).",
    },
    {
      name: "rate",
      desc: "Playback rate multiplier. 1.0 is normal speed, 0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is double speed. Defaults to 1.",
    },
  ]}
