# Inspector

The Inspector window displays the properties of the currently selected game objects and assets. It allows you to view and modify the attributes of the selected items directly.

On the default layout, Inspector is on the right side of the screen. You can dock this wherever you want.

## Common Asset Settings

When you select an object in the **Asset Viewer**, a set of settings specific to that asset type will be displayed. Below are the commonly available options:

### Export for Code

Enables the asset to be accessed via code. For example, if this option is disabled, attempting to retrieve the asset using `getTexture2D(texId)` will not work.

### Enable Atlas

If applicable, includes the asset in a texture atlas to optimize rendering performance.

### Enable Tiny

Minifies the image during asset generation, reducing file size.

### Loop

**Audio assets only.** If enabled, the audio will loop continuously when played.

### Set as Global Font

**Font assets only.** Sets the selected font as the global font. All `Text` objects configured to use **Global Font** as their **font family** will automatically update to use this font.
