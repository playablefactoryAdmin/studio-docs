# View

<Image src="/studio-docs/basics/view/view.png" alt="view" width={1000} height={400} className="pt-6" />

This panel provides a visual preview of your game as it would appear on the selected device screen. It also allows for real-time editing of game object properties.
You can select, inspect, and modify the properties of each game object dynamically during development.

### Screen Control Toolbar

<Image src="/studio-docs/basics/view/screen-type-selection.png" alt="view" width={300} height={400} className="pt-6" />

To quickly preview how your game would look in other screens such as **iPhone XR** or **iPad**, use this toolbar. 

Screen control toolbar exists on top-right corner on 2D projects. On 3D projects, you can see this this toolbar on top-center.

- Left button allows you to toggle between screens quickly.
- Center dropdown allows you to select the screen type you wish to preview.
- Right button allows you to toggle between portrait and landscape mode. 

## 3D Projects

On 3D projects, view panel is a little bit more complicated because you need to switch between 2D and 3D views. To achieve this
seamlessly, in the top-right corner there will be a toggle to switch between 2D and 3D views.

### Transform Tools Panel

<Image src="/studio-docs/basics/view/transform-toolbox.gif" alt="view" width={1000} height={400} className="pt-6" />

This panel provides tools for manipulating game objects in the scene. From top to bottom, the first three buttons let you switch between:

* Move Tool – for adjusting position (translation)

* Rotate Tool – for rotating the object

* Scale Tool – for resizing the object

When the "Local" checkbox is enabled, transformations are applied relative to the object's local coordinate system instead of the global (world) coordinate system.

### Renderer Settings

In 3D projects, when you're in 3D View, an additional button appears to the left of the 2D/3D view toggle. 
This button opens the Renderer Settings, allowing you to configure rendering options specific to the current 3D view.
