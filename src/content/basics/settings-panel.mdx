This contains main settings for your game. You can find it in the bottom left corner
of the screen.

## General

General settings section contains core configuration options.

| Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Libraries                       | Choosing between 2D Pixi.js or 3D Three.js rendering libraries. Affects which rendering engine is included. 3D includes 2D library as well.                                              |
| Enable Audio                    | Controls whether audio functionality is included in the build.                                                                                                                           |
| Convert Fonts to WOFF2          | Boolean option that automatically converts font files to WOFF2 format during build process. WOFF2 provides better compression and faster loading times for web deployment.               |
| Render 2D and 3D on Same Canvas | \*Experimental\* Boolean setting that determines whether 2D and 3D content should be rendered on a single canvas element.                                                                |
| Enable Base122                  | \*Experimental\* Boolean toggle for Base122 encoding support. Base122 is a more efficient encoding method that can reduce payload size for certain data types in network communications. |
| Preloader                       | Choosing the default preloader style and behavior. Controls the loading screen appearance and progression display while game assets are being loaded.                                    |
| Screen Lock                     | Orientation lock setting with options for Default, Portrait, Landscape. Default means both orientations are allowed.                                                                     |
