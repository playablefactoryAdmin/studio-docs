# Find and Get Nodes in Scene

Let's make a simple node hierarchy like this:

<Image src="/studio-docs/tutorial/find-nodes-in-scene/node-hierarchy.png" alt="add responsive" width={400} height={400} className="mt-6 rounded-xl" />

Now create a gameManager script using the [Script System](/advanced/scripting-system.mdx).

After that step, open the newly created script file, and modify the `awake` function as seen below.

```js
import { getObject2D } from "utils2D";

awake(props={}){
    this.props = props;
    const uiText = getObject2D("mySpecial_UI_Text");
    console.log(uiText)
}
```

Return back to your game and you should be able to see the node printed to the console.
