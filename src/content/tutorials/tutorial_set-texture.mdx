# Setting a Texture in Studio

After making a texture's exportForCode property enabled and a given id, simply get the texture first:

```js
const myTexture = getTexture2D(textureId)
```

After that, set the sprite texture using:

```js
this.sprite.setTextureFrame(myTexture) //do not use setTexture inside Studio.
```
