# Store

The Store allows you to use prefabs you've previously created, whether by other developers or yourself, across all your projects. This saves you time by avoiding re-creating common functions and components across many projects.

## How To Open Store

You can open the Store by clicking the Store button in the Toolbar. (You can also perform this function from the Store tab on the home page.)
