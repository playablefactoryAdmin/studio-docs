# Adding Backgrounds

Backgrounds are basically the setting behind a main subject. It must fill the entire screen.

To do this for every device size possible, it has to be responsive. Select the object you would like to use it as background, and add
a [Responsive2D](/2d/components/responsive-component.mdx) component.

After creating your `Responsive2D` component, set the fit type to either `Max` or `Stretch`. This can depend on the type of background you will use.
For this example, we are using a gradient fill, so the `Stretch` option will work better here. For stuff like images, `Max` would be a better choice.

After selecting your desired fit type, set **width** and **height ratio** to `100`. This will make it span the entire screen.
