## 3D Development Workflow

### 1. Scene Setup
- Create a new 3D project
- Set up cameras and lighting
- Import or create 3D models

### 2. Material Creation
- Use the material system to create realistic materials
- Apply textures and configure material properties
- Set up lighting and shading

### 3. Animation
- Add skeletal animations to models
- Create keyframe animations for objects
- Set up animation triggers and events

### 4. Physics
- Add physics components to objects
- Configure collision detection
- Set up physics interactions

### 5. Optimization
- Optimize models and textures
- Configure LOD (Level of Detail) systems
- Test performance across different devices

## Best Practices

1. **Model Optimization**: Keep polygon counts reasonable for your target platforms
2. **Texture Management**: Use appropriate texture sizes and formats
3. **Lighting**: Balance performance with visual quality in lighting setup
4. **Material Efficiency**: Use efficient materials and avoid unnecessary complexity
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly test performance on target devices
6. **Asset Organization**: Keep your 3D assets well-organized in the project

## Performance Considerations

- **Polygon Count**: Monitor and optimize polygon counts for smooth performance
- **Texture Memory**: Manage texture memory usage efficiently
- **Draw Calls**: Minimize draw calls through batching and optimization
- **LOD Systems**: Implement Level of Detail systems for distant objects
- **Culling**: Use frustum and occlusion culling to improve performance
