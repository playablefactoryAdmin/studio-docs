Studio's mesh component enables users to interact with the [Material System](/3d/advanced/material-system.mdx).

Skeletal Meshes does not have `Cast Shadow` and `Receive Shadow` properties exposed to the Studio. 

These properties are inherited from `THREE.Object3D`. Since nearly all game objects in Three.js are subclasses of `THREE.Object3D`, and Studio subclasses most of these objects, 
you can access and modify these properties directly via scripting. 
To do so, simply access the desired node and set the property as needed:

```ts
this.node.castShadow = true;
```

### Material

On click, a dropdown menu appears, allowing you to select which material to apply to this game object.
For more information, refer to the [Material System](/3d/advanced/material-system.mdx) page.
