# Light Component

Every light object holds a light component. On top of having a light component, they might have a specialized component as well.
For example, **Ambient Light** only holds a light component. **Directional Light** holds a **Light Component** and a **Directional Light** component.

Settings on this component is very straight-forward. Color sets the color of the light, while intensity sets the intensity of the light.

## Point Light

### Distance

When the distance value is zero, the light intensity diminishes following the inverse-square law indefinitely. 
If the distance is set to a non-zero value, the light follows the inverse-square attenuation up to near that distance, after which it rapidly and smoothly fades to zero. 

For more information, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight.distance).

### Decay

This value controls how quickly the light intensity decreases with distance. The default is 2, corresponding to physically accurate inverse-square attenuation. 

For more information, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight.decay).

### Shadow

Enables dynamic shadows. This is expensive. For more details, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight.castShadow).

## Directional Light

### Target

Acts like the rotation of a directional light in other game engines.

### Debug

Enables light debug lines.

### Shadow

Enables dynamic shadows. This is expensive. For more details, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/DirectionalLight.castShadow).

## Spot Light

### Target

Acts like the rotation of the light in other game engines.

### Angle

Specifies the maximum angle, in radians, that the spotlight extends from its central direction

### Penumbra

Defines the percentage of the spotlight cone affected by the penumbra â€” the soft edge where light gradually fades. Higher values result in a smoother transition between light and shadow.

### Distance and Decay

Works similar to [Point Light's](#point-light).

### Debug

Enables light debug lines.

### Shadow

Enables dynamic shadows. This is expensive. For more details, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/DirectionalLight.castShadow).

## Hemisphere Light

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/3d/light-hemisphere-component.gif" alt="Hemisphere Light Component" width={800} height={600} className="pt-6" />

A light source placed above the scene that simulates environmental lighting by blending from a sky color overhead to a ground color below, 
creating a subtle gradient that mimics natural ambient illumination.

### Sky Color

Light's sky color.

### Ground Color

Light's ground color.

### Debug

Enables light debug lines.
