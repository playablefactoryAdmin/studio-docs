# Primitives

All of the primitives below are simply classes extended from `THREE.Mesh` and given the corresponding geometry. 

For example, for the Box primitive:

```ts
const boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const boxMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0xffffff });

class Box extends THREE.Mesh {
	constructor(material?: THREE.Material) {
		super(boxGeometry, material || boxMaterial);
	}
}
```

## Box

Geometry given to this primitive is:

```ts
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
```

## Cylinder

Geometry given to this primitive is:

```ts
const geometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(1, 1, 1, 16);
```

## Sphere

Geometry given to this primitive is:

```ts
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16);
```

## Plane

Geometry given to this primitive is:

```ts
const geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, 1);
```
