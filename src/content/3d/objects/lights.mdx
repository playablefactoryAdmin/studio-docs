Lights created in Studio are built directly on top of the native light classes from **Three.js**. They retain full compatibility and functionality from Three.js, while integrating into the Studio ecosystem through the implementation of the `StudioObject3D` interface.

Each light type listed below is a subclass of its corresponding `THREE.Light` (or light-related) class, with added support for Studio-specific systems such as components, selection, and editor interactions.

This allows you to use and configure lights in Studio exactly as you would in Three.js, with additional Studio features layered on top.

Below are the demonstrations for each light type.

## Point Light

A type of light source that radiates outward uniformly from a central point. This is typically used to simulate illumination from an exposed bulb or similar omnidirectional light emitter.

To learn more about this, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight).

## Ambient Light

This type of light provides uniform illumination across all objects in the scene, regardless of their position or orientation.

Think of it as adding brightness to even the areas untouched by direct light or shadows.

To learn more about this, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/AmbientLight).

## Directional Light

A directional light source emits light in a single, consistent direction. 
This is often used to mimic sunlight, as the sun is far enough away for its rays to be treated as parallel and its position as infinitely far.

To learn more about this, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/DirectionalLight).

## Spot Light

This light originates from a single point and projects outward in a specific direction, forming a cone that widens with distance from the source.

To learn more about this, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/SpotLight).

## Hemisphere Light

A light source placed above the scene that simulates ambient sky lighting, with its color gradually blending from the sky hue overhead to the ground tone below.

In the example below, sky color is white, while ground color is completely black.

To learn more about this, check [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/HemisphereLight).
