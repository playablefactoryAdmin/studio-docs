When you drag and drop a .gltf object to your scene, you will see pop-up, asking you to choose a type. This page is for the `Deconstructed` type.
For the packaged model type, check [Model](model.mdx) instead.

The Deconstructed type is recommended if you plan to:

* Add or remove child objects within the model hierarchy

* Modify individual materials or meshes

* Customize the internal structure of the model in detail

Unlike the Packaged type, which treats the model as a single unit, the Deconstructed import fully loads the .gltf file and iterates through its internal nodes, 
adding each child object separately to the Studio hierarchy.

This allows for greater flexibility and control over the model's components, making it ideal for more complex editing workflows.

### Class Signature

```ts
class InlineModel extends THREE.Object3D implements StudioObject3D
````

### Properties

<UserTable data={[
{ name: "sID", desc: "Unique session ID assigned by Studio." },
{ name: "internalAnimationPlayer", desc: "Instance of `Animation3DPlayer` that handles animation playback for the inline model." },
{ name: "modelAnimations", desc: "Array of `THREE.AnimationClip` objects extracted from the model." },
{ name: "modelRef", desc: "Reference to the `THREE.Object3D` that was passed into the constructor." },
{ name: "eventEmitter", desc: "Global `EventEmitter` used to broadcast animation and component updates to the editor." },
{ name: "isInlineModel", desc: "Boolean flag indicating this is an inline model." },
{ name: "componentRef", desc: "Reference to the current `InlineModelGC` component instance." },
]} />

Since each child object of the model is loaded and managed separately, the `InlineModel` class **solely** handles animation-related functionality. 
It does not manage any other aspects of the model such as materials, transformations, or hierarchy beyond animation playback.

Each individual game object within the model hierarchy is responsible for managing its own properties and behaviors independently.

### Skeletal Meshes and Bones

These special game objects are exclusively loaded via this specific loading method. Unlike other Studio objects, they **do not possess special components**.

Notably, skeletal meshes within these objects can only be transformed or animated by manipulating their bones directly, similar to how other game engines handle skeletal meshes and bone-based animations.
