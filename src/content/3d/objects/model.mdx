When you drag and drop a .gltf object to your scene, you will see pop-up, asking you to choose a type. This page is for the `Packaged` type.
For the destructured model type, check [Inline Model](inlinemodel.mdx) instead.

This model type is recommended if you are planning on using [Buckets](/advanced/buckets). This type loads the entire .gltf object as a single object 
and does not generate materials for you. If you want to access the child nodes and see the materials, use [Inline Model](inlinemodel.mdx) instead.

In detail, this object is the entire scene loaded into **Studio** as one single node. 

The `Model` class extends `THREE.Object3D` and implements the `StudioObject3D` type. It serves as the main representation of a 3D model within the Studio environment, supporting component updates, animation playback, morph targets, and integration with the editor's event system.

```ts
gltfLoader.load(gltfObjectPath, (gltf: any)=>{
    gltf.scene //this is the object that gets created as one single node.
})
```
