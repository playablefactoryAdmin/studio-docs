<SpecialHeader title="Quarks Particle" />

In 3D, we use the <a href="https://quarks.art/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: "#3182ce", textDecoration: "underline" }}>Quarks library</a> to work with particles. Quarks is a JSON format that comes with textures and properties.
To use it in the game, we put the particle's json file in `assets/quarkEffects`.

Then we click on json file from editor and from inspector we see the properties of the particle.

- `Number of particles` : Number of particles to be created in pool.
- `Export for Code 3D` : In game usage name.

<Callout type="info">
<div className="-mt-3">
  Number of particles shouldn't be too high, it is important for performance
  to create the necessary number of particles. Pool is created based on the
  number of particles to recycle.
</div>
</Callout>

Then in code, we use it like this;

```js
Particle3D.spawnAt("Comic_Hit", new Vector3(0, 0, 0), 1);
```

### spawnAt Parameters

<UserTable
  data={[
    { name: "name", desc: "Name of the particle." },
    { name: "position", desc: "Position of the particle." },
    { name: "scale", desc: "Scale of the particle." },
    {
      name: "scene",
      desc: "(Optional) Scene to spawn the particle in. It defaults to the current scene.",
    },
  ]}
/>

`spawnAt` returns a `QuarksParticle` class that extends `Object3D`, you can make position and rotation adjustments after spawn, but the rotation settings are not very reliable, they may not work as expected.

### QuarksParticle Methods

<UserTable
  data={[
    {
      name: "stop(true)",
      desc: "Stops the particle, if you write true to the parameter, it stops immediately",
    },
    { name: "restart", desc: "Restarts the particle." },
  ]}
/>

##### Notes

- **My particle is not appearing in the desired position**

This is most likely because the particleâ€™s `worldSpace` property is still set to true.
`worldSpace` can be useful in cases like exhaust effects, where the particle should maintain its position after being emitted.
However, for effects that should stay local to their parent (like spinning in place), disabling `worldSpace` gives better results.
To disable it, open the .json file and change any `worldSpace: true` entries to `false`.

- **My particle works fine the first 4 times, but on the 5th time it doesn't appear or appears somewhere else.**

This is definitely related to `worldSpace`. The incorrect position on the 5th time likely happens because the pool's `maxLen` is reached and it wraps around.
But if you're keeping `worldSpace` as true and want to fix the position, assign the particle to a variable during `spawnAt`, like this:

```js
efk.stop(true);
gsap.delayedCall(0.01, () => {
  //in essence, it should be called in the next frame, 0.01 is hypothetical
  efk.restart();
});
```
