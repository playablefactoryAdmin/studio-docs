## Enable Shadow Map in Renderer Settings

Before setting up shadows for your lights and objects, you must first enable shadow mapping in the renderer settings.

1. Open the **Renderer Settings** panel (located in the right top corner of the view)
2. In the **Inspector** panel, find the **Shadow Map** checkbox
3. Check the **Shadow Map** option to enable shadow rendering

  alt="Renderer Settings - Enable Shadow Map"
  width={500}
  height={300}
  className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
/>

Once shadow mapping is enabled, you can proceed with configuring shadows for your lights and objects.

## Shadow Map Types

Three.js offers different shadow map types that affect the quality and performance of shadows in your scene. You can select the shadow map type in the renderer settings:

- **BasicShadowMap**: Provides unfiltered shadow maps. This option is the fastest but offers the lowest quality shadows with hard edges.

- **PCFShadowMap**: Utilizes the Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF) algorithm to filter shadow maps, resulting in smoother edges compared to BasicShadowMap. This is the default setting in Three.js.

- **PCFSoftShadowMap**: An enhanced version of PCFShadowMap that offers even softer shadows, especially beneficial when using low-resolution shadow maps.

- **VSMShadowMap**: Employs the Variance Shadow Map (VSM) algorithm for filtering. When using VSMShadowMap, all shadow receivers will also cast shadows, which can lead to more realistic lighting but may impact performance.

> **Performance Note**: Higher quality shadow map types (PCFSoftShadowMap, VSMShadowMap) provide better visual results but may impact performance, especially on lower-end devices.

## Configure Light Shadows

Click on the `Directional Light` from the hierarcy.

<Callout type="warning">
<div className="-mt-3">
  You should not assign the castShadow or receiveShadow property directly to the
  model. Since the model is composed of multiple meshes, you need to assign
  these properties to each mesh individually.
</div>
</Callout>

  width={500}
  height={300}
  className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
/>

The `shadow panel` will appear at the `bottom right` of the studio.

## 1. Enable shadow casting for objects:

You need to check the `Enable` option.

Objects in your scene wonâ€™t automatically cast or receive shadows. You have to tell them to do that.

- `castShadow:` If set to true, the object will block the light and cast a shadow.

- `receiveShadow:` If set to true, the object will receive shadows cast by other objects.

<Callout type="warning">
<div className="-mt-3">

  You should not assign the castShadow or receiveShadow property directly to the
  model. Since the model is composed of multiple meshes, you need to assign
  these properties to each mesh individually.
</div>
</Callout>

Enable shadow casting for objects:

```js
model.traverse((child) => {
  if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
    child.castShadow = true;
  }
});
```

Enable shadow receiving for objects:

```js
model.traverse((child) => {
  if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
    child.receiveShadow = true;
  }
});
```

An object can both cast shadows and receive them.

```js
model.traverse((child) => {
  if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
    child.receiveShadow = true;
    child.castShadow = true;
  }
});
```

## 2. Bias:

Depth precision in shadow rendering can cause artifacts like shadow acne, where surfaces incorrectly receive shadows due to z-fighting.

Adjusting the shadow bias can help with this issue.

> Do not change it unless shadow artifacts occur.

## 3. MapSize:

Higher values provide better quality shadows but increase computation time.

Values must be powers of 2 (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048).

<Callout type="warning">
<div className="-mt-3">
  Increasing the shadow map size to larger values (e.g., 2048 or above) can
  significantly improve shadow quality but may also lead to higher memory usage
  and decreased performance.
</div>
</Callout>

## 4. Area:

This setting allows you to control the size of the shadow area, helping you decide how big or small the shadows are and where they will show up in the scene.

> Not all lights in Three.js can cast shadows. The ones that do are:

> - SpotLight
