# Materials with Inline Meshes

When you try to add a .gltf model to your scene, you will see a prompt on your screen, asking you to choose between **Packaged** or **Destructed** model type.
For more information regarding this prompt please check [model](3d/objects/model.mdx). In this example, we will continue with Destructed node type.

After selection, Studio automatically generates the materials within the .gltf file for use in Studio.

These are special types of materials. They will hold their original values inside them and you can revert the changes you've made to these 
material objects using the `Revert Material` button.

  height={300}
  className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
/>

It will look greyed out if you did not make any changes to the selected material.

When replacing the .gltf file in place, Studio attempts to automatically match materials and meshes. If it fails, it substitutes a standard 'missing material' and a placeholder cube geometry.

If you've previously modified imported materials, you can revert them to the original version from the new .gltf file. Unmodified materials are updated automatically.
