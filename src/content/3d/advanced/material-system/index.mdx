# Material System

You can create any material type using the Material Panel in the Asset Viewer. To learn how to create a material, visit the [Material Panel](/basics/asset-viewer/material-panel) page.

There are multiple shader types as seen in the creation menu. Simply select one and you can see it's properties on the right side.

### Basics Tab

These are the common **basic** settings for every material type. These are not Studio-related settings. 
For more information regarding these material settings, check [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) documentation.

### Advanced Tab

  height={300}
  className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
/>

These are the common **advanced** settings for every material type. These are not Studio-related settings.

### Specifics Tab

  alt="specifics"
  width={325}

These are the material specific settings for every material type. These are not Studio-related settings. Settings exposed to this tab depends on what type of material it is.

In this example, the shader type is **Standard**, so you'll have settings such as shininess, roughness etc. If you create a basic material, you'll see that you only have the wireframe option. 

For more information regarding the specific material settings, check [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) documentation and navigate to the specific material type you want.
