const scene = getCurrentScene3D();
// or alternatively
const scene = globals.threeScene;
```

#### getScene3DByName

      desc: "The name of the scene to retrieve.",
    },
  ]}
/>

<InnerHeader title="Example Usage" />

```js
const otherScene = getScene3DByName("Scene Name");
```

#### getScene3DList

```ts
getScene3DList(): Scene3D[]
```

      desc: "Boolean flag to determine if you want to remove all active scenes before starting the new one.",
    },
  ]}
/>

<InnerHeader title="Example Usage" />

```

#### restartScene3D
