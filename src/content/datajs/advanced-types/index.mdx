# Advanced Types

The Data.js library includes advanced data types that offer more specialized or customized functionality. These types provide flexibility for handling unique data requirements. This section provides documentation for the following advanced types:

- [Custom](advanced-types/customdata.md)
- [Repeater](advanced-types/repeaterdata.md)

## Custom

The `Custom` data type is a versatile data type that allows you to define custom or specialized data structures that don't fit into predefined types. It can be used to implement unique data needs and execute custom actions.

## Repeater

The `Repeater` data type is used for representing repeatable or iterable data structures. It allows you to define a list of data items that can be repeated multiple times, such as to-do lists or items that can be added dynamically.
