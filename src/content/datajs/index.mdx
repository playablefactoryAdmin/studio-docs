# Data.js Documentation

This documentation provides information about the various data types and structures available in the Data.js system to use in platform.

## Introduction

Data.js is a configuration format used to define adjustable game parameters. When parsed by the platform, each entry in the JSON is converted into a corresponding UI component (e.g. sliders, toggles, color pickers), allowing platform users to modify values at runtime without directly editing code.
The primary goal of datajs is to expose configurable game logic through a structured interface.

## How to use

### Declare core game variables

Begin by declaring the core game variables in a `params.js` file. These variables act as centralized constants or stateful parameters used throughout gameplay logic.

```javascript
export const params = {
  ...
  playerSpeed: 10,
  ...
};
```

### Reference core game variables

In your game code, reference the variables from params.js wherever needed. This ensures that all configurable behavior is driven by a single source. It's exported as `data` object from params.js.
You can reference it from globals or app object.

```javascript
import { data } from "globals";

player.velocity.x = input * data.playerSpeed;

// or without importing globals
player.velocity.x = input * app.data.playerSpeed;
```

### Create a datajs file

Modify `data.js` file to describe which parameters should be externally adjustable. Each entry in datajs maps to a field in params.js using its id.

```json
{
  {
    "id":"playerSpeed",
    "type": "range",
    "min": 0,
    "max": 10,
    "step": 1,
    "default": 10
  }
}
```

### Upload the datajs JSON file

Data.js file is going to be generated as data.json file while uploading the game.
Once the datajs file is uploaded to the platform, it dynamically generates UI controls (sliders, toggles, etc.) based on the definitions. When a user adjusts a value through the interface, the corresponding field in params.js is updated after refreshing the game or real time based on the implementation.
