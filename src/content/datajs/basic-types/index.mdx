# Basic Types

In the Data.js library, you'll find a variety of basic data types that allow you to represent and work with fundamental data structures. These basic types are essential for building more complex data structures and applications. This section provides documentation for the following basic types:

- [Boolean](basic-types/booleandata.md)
- [Range](basic-types/rangedata.md)
- [Color](basic-types/colordata.md)
- [Text](basic-types/textdata.md)

## Boolean

The `Boolean` data type allows you to represent boolean values, typically `true` or `false`. It's used for situations where you need to make binary choices or decisions.

## Range

The `Range` data type is used to represent numeric values within a specified range. It's commonly used for setting numeric parameters that have minimum and maximum values.
