# Linked Variables

Some properties of an object might be linkable to Data.js and therefore to the platform.

You can find out what properties are linkable by looking at the property and checking if it has the 
icon seen below.

<Image src="/studio-docs/advanced/linked-vars/linkable-variable-example.png" alt="overview" width={400} height={300} className="mt-6 rounded-xl overflow-hidden" />

Click the link icon to open a pop-up window. You will be prompted to provide a name for the variable. This is **not** the ID â€” the ID is assigned internally.
Simply specify the "title" you want the variable to display on the platform.

After clicking **Save & Generate**, your Data.js file will update. After uploading your game to the platform, you should be able to see and control the property you linked with on the platform.

By default, new property will be generated inside the "Sound" category. It is highly recommended that you create your own categories and assign the relevant properties inside that category. 

For more information, check the [Data.js](/datajs/) main page.
