# Scripting System

Studio has an in-depth scripting system. Nearly all objects can hold multiple scripts as a component.
Using scripts, you can add behavior to your game objects.

## Creating Script Files

On the asset viewer, press the `+` button and select the script type you want to create. You will see 4 types of scripts:

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row ">
  <Image
    src="/studio-docs/advanced/script-creation.png"
    alt="Scripting System"
    width={400}
    height={300}
    className="mt-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden"
  />
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center px-8">
    * Add 3D Script 
    * Add 3D Script (TypeScript) 
    * Add 2D Script 
    * Add 2D Script
    (TypeScript)
  </div>
</div>

Simply select the script type you want to create and press the `Create` button.

## Script Structure

```js
export default class Temp2d extends Script2D /* - or Script3d*/ {
  //...public variables...

  awake() {}

  init() {}
  update(delta) {}
  resize(w, h) {}
  onRemove() {}

  onAdd() {}
}
```

<UserTable
  data={[
    { name: "awake", desc: "Runs first for all game objects." },
    {
      name: "init",
      desc: "Runs after every game object finishes their awake function.",
    },
    {
      name: "update(delta)",
      desc: "Runs every frame. `delta` is the time since the last frame.",
    },
    {
      name: "resize(w, h)",
      desc: "Runs when the window is resized. `w` and `h` are the new width and height of the window.",
    },
    {
      name: "onRemove",
      desc: "Runs when the script is removed from the game object.",
    },
    {
      name: "onAdd",
      desc: "Runs when the script is added to the game object.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Adding Scripts to Objects and Deletion

Simply select a game object, and on the inspector view, press `Add Component` -> `Script`.

With this, your object will have a script component. But it does not have the script yet. For that, press the `Add Script` button
and select your script.

To delete a script, simply hover over the script in the Script Component and press the red trash icon.

<Image
  src="/studio-docs/advanced/script-add-delete.gif"
  alt="Scripting Add Delete"
  width={400}
  height={300}
  className="mt-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden"
/>

## Exposing Variables to Studio

When working with Studio, exposing variables correctly is essential for enabling user interaction and property customization. The approach differs slightly between TypeScript and JavaScript.

### JavaScript

In JavaScript, you must use JSDoc-style annotations to expose variables to Studio. This allows Studio to recognize and manage the variables appropriately.

Use the `/**@@type{Type}*/` syntax and ensure each declaration is properly terminated with a semicolon `(;)`. Make sure do not leave any space between type. Below are examples:

```js
/**@@type{Boolean}*/
testBool = true;

/**@@type{Color}*/
testColor = "#40277a";

/**@@type{Number}*/
testNumber = 10;

/**@@type{String}*/
testString = "Hello, world!";

/**@@type{Vector2}*/
testVector2 = { x: 10, y: 20 };

/**@@type{Vector3}*/
testVector3 = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 };

/**@@type{ScriptClass}*/
testScriptOwnerObject = null;

/**@@type{ComponentType}*/
testComponentTypeObject = null;
```

### TypeScript

In TypeScript, you must use `//@public` decorator for the variable to show up in Studio.

```ts
//@public
public testString: string = "hello!";

//@public
public testNumber: number = 10;

//@public
public testBoolean: boolean = true;

//@public
public testColor: Color = "#40277a";

//@public
public testVector2: Vector2 = { x: 10, y: 20 };

//@public
public testVector3: Vector3 = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 };

//@public
public testScriptOwnerObject: ScriptClass = null;

//@public
public testComponentTypeObject: ComponentType = null;
```

<Callout type="info">
  ScriptClass is the script that is attached to the game object. When you
  declare a public variable with a specific script type like ScriptClass, the
  editor filters the selectable objects to only show those that have that script
  attached.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  ComponentType is main basic types like Sprite, PerspectiveCamera, Mesh, etc.
</Callout>

### Adding Scripts In Runtime

You can add scripts to game objects in runtime for more dynamic or complex logic.
For 2D use `addScript2D` and for 3D use `addScript3D`.

```ts
const myObject = new Object3D(); //any object type
const script1 = new Humanoid();
const script2 = new Walker();
const script3 = new PlayerController();

addScript(myObject, [script1, script2, script3]);
```

<Callout type="info">
  When scripts added this way, their awake method will be called immediately.
  Init method will be called at beginning of it's first update.
</Callout>
