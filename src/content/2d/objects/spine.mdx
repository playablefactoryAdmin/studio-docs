Create a `Spine` object by right clicking in the hierarchy and selecting `Add Node` → `Core` → `Spine`.

The Spine object plays skeletal animations exported from Spine Editor and loaded through `Cache2D`. It supports animation control, custom playback speed, skin switching, and texture overrides.

It uses the `@pixi/spine` runtime and wraps it to be usable in the Studio engine.

#### updateSpineComponent

```ts
updateSpineComponent(component: SpineGC): void
```

Updates animation, texture, skin, speed, and autoplay/loop settings.

<InnerHeader title="Parameters"/>

```

Alias for `play`.

---

#### addAnimation

```ts
addAnimation(animationName: string, loop: boolean, callback?: () => void): this

setSkinByName(skinName: string): this
```

Sets the active skin by name.

---

#### replaceSlotTexture

```ts
replaceSlotTexture(slotName: string, pixiTexture: PIXI.Texture): void
```
