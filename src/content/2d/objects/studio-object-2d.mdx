<SpecialHeader
    title="StudioObject2D"
/>

This is not a class, it's a type. StudioObject2D is defined as:
```ts
export type StudioObject2D = PixiObject2D & PIXI.Container;
```
It is important to note that additional functionality has been added to the `PIXI.Container` prototype. Further details can be found [here](container.mdx).

### PixiObject2D

```ts twoslash
type Components2D = {}
// ---cut---
type PixiObject2D = {
	id: string;
	type: string;
	label: string;
	components: Components2D;
	updateComponents: (components: any) => void;
	getComponent: (component: string) => any;
	selected: boolean;
	locked: boolean;
	componentsData?: any;
	nodeData?: any;
	isContainer?: boolean;
	customUpdate?: (delta: number) => void;
};
```
