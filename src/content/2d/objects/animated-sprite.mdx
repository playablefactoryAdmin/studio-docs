Create an `Animated Sprite` in **Studio** by right clicking on the hierarchy and selecting `Add Node` -> `Core` -> `Animated Sprite`.

Animated Sprite takes a JSON data file and a corresponding sprite sheet, then plays animations based on the defined frames and sequences.

Since it's extended from `PIXI.AnimatedSprite`, it has all the functionality of it. This class does not have prototype extensions.

Some of the key features such as `animationSpeed` comes from `PIXI.AnimatedSprite` class. Please check `PixiJS` documentation first for basic functionality.

        {name: "animData", desc: "Animation data from Cache2D."},
    ]
} />

<InnerHeader title="Example Usage"/>

```js
Cache2D.getAnimation(animationTextureKey, (data) => { //animationTextureKey is the exportForCode id.
    anim.changeAnimationTexture(data);
