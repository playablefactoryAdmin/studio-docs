# Physics 2D

Studio’s Physics 2D functionality is powered by the Box2D engine. To utilize this feature, you must first enable and configure the appropriate settings.

Navigate to the following path within the Settings menu: `2D` -> `Physics 2D`. Set the  `Physics2D Type` to `Box2D`. This action enables the Box2D engine and allows Studio to load the necessary physics library.

Once these steps are completed, Physics 2D support using Box2D will be active within your project.

After enabling Physics 2D in the settings, you need to designate the specific Scene in which physics should be applied.

In the [Hierarchy](/basics/hierarchy) panel, select the Scene you want to enable physics for.

You need to enable the `Enable Physics2D` option. After that, you need to select the container that needs to act as the "world". 
For more info, check [understanding 2d physics simulation](#understanding-2d-physics-simulation) section.

Now Physics2D is ready to be used. You can also enable the debug option in the Physics2D settings to visualize your bounds.

Now add a [Physics component](../2d/components/physics-component.mdx) to your game object and put it as a child to your Physics world. Don't forget to set it to dynamic. It should just fall down.

## Understanding 2D Physics Simulation

Physics in Studio must be applied directly to a single top-level container—nesting physics-enabled objects inside other containers is not supported and will result in unexpected behavior.

<Callout type="warning">
<div className="-mt-4">
    If you assign a Physics Component to a child object that is nested inside a container placed under a Physics World, the physics simulation will not function correctly for that child. 
    This is because the physics engine only recognizes objects directly under the physics world hierarchy.
</div>
</Callout>
To ensure proper simulation:

* Apply the Physics Component to direct children of the world container.

* Avoid placing physics-enabled objects inside nested containers.

This structure is necessary due to how the physics world tracks and updates object transformations during simulation.
