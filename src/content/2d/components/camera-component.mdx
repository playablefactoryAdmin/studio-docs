The Camera Component controls how the camera behaves in the world, including input, zooming, bounds, and following targets.

### Debug

Enables a debug view that shows the camera's bounding box and target frame. Useful during level design and testing.

### World Size

Defines the size of the world the camera operates in.
This is used for boundary clamping and zoom calculations.


### Direction

Specifies the clamping direction:

* Horizontal
* Vertical
* Both
* None


### Enable Drag Input

Allows users to drag the camera using pointer input (typically mouse or touch).


### Drag Smoothing

Applies a smoothing factor to the drag input.
When the user stops dragging, the camera eases to a stop based on this multiplier.


### Enable Zoom Input

Enables camera zoom control using scroll or pinch gestures.


### Clamp Zoom

Restricts the zoom level to stay within the **Max Zoom Multiplier** range.


### Max Zoom Multiplier

Sets the upper limit for how far the camera can zoom in or out.


### Target

An object or container that the camera will follow automatically.


### Target Follow Smoothness

Controls how smoothly the camera follows its target.

* `0`: Snap to target position
* `>0`: Smoothly interpolate toward the target

Higher values result in slower, smoother motion.
