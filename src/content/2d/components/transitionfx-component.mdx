### Name

The name of the Transition FX. This will appear in the tab view and serves as the identifier for the animation.

### Transition Type

A dropdown menu to select the type of transition. Each option is self-explanatory and defines the animation behavior.

### Duration

Specifies the length of the animation in seconds.

### Delay

Sets a delay before the animation starts, in seconds.

### Repeat

Defines how many times the animation should repeat. Use `-1` for infinite looping.

### Repeat Delay

Adds a delay between repeated animation cycles.

### Yoyo

Enables the animation to reverse direction on every other repeat cycle. Useful for creating ping-pong effects.

### Ease

Choose from predefined GSAP easing functions. You can fine-tune the animation curve using the curve editor located on the right panel.

### Autoplay

When enabled, the animation starts automatically upon creation.

### Hide on Complete

If checked, the target object will be hidden after the animation completes.

<Callout type="info">Example: If an animation reduces an objectâ€™s scale to `0`, but the object also has a responsive component, it may become visible again on resize. Enabling this option ensures it stays hidden.</Callout>

### Event Names

Select the event names that will trigger this animation. Use `globals.eventEmitter.emit(eventName)` to programmatically fire the animation.

### Next FX

Specifies the next animation (on the same component) that should play after this one finishes.
