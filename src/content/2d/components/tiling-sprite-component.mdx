This component is automatically added to all **Tiling Sprite** objects.

The top three tabs function identically to those in the [Sprite Component](/2d/components/sprite-component.mdx).  
If you're unfamiliar with those, we recommend reviewing that page first.

## Tint

Applies a solid color tint to the entire tiling sprite.


## Tile Position

Defines the offset at which the texture is drawn inside the tiling sprite.

For example, with a 100×50 (width × height) texture:
- Setting the tile position to `50×50` will offset the tiling so that the center acts as the new origin.
- The visible result is the texture being shifted and mirrored from the center.

We recommend experimenting with this parameter to better understand its visual effect:

<Slider
    width={600}
    height={600}
    src1={"/studio-docs/components/examples/tilingsprite-tileposition/tilingimage-before.png"}
    src2={"/studio-docs/components/examples/tilingsprite-tileposition/tilingimage-after.png"}
/>

## Tile Scale

Scales the repeating texture.

- `1.0` is the original scale.
- Increasing values zoom out (showing more tiles), while decreasing values zoom in.

## Width

Defines the width of the tiling sprite's render area.

In most cases, this should match the **texture's original width**.

## Height

Defines the height of the tiling sprite's render area.

In most cases, this should match the **texture's original height**.
