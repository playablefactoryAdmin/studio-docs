# NineSlice Component

import Image from "next/image";

This component is automatically added to all NineSlice Sprite objects.

The top three tabs function identically to those in the [Sprite Component](/2d/components/sprite-component.mdx). 
If you're unfamiliar with those, we recommend reviewing that page first.

The NineSlice Component allows you to scale UI elements such as panels, windows, or buttons without distortion. It works by dividing the texture into 9 regions:

- Corners stay fixed
- Edges stretch in one direction
- Center stretches freely

This way, corners retain their original shape even when the object is resized.

**Do not use the scale settings when you are using this component. Use width and height settings of this component instead.**

### Texture

The source texture used for the NineSlice object.

### Left / Right / Top / Bottom

These values define the **inset boundaries** — how far from each edge the slicing occurs.

For example:

* `Left = 10` means the leftmost 10px will not stretch.
* `Top = 20` means the top 20px is preserved as-is.

Adjust these based on your UI design to control which parts stretch and which parts stay sharp.

### Width / Height

Final rendered size of the NineSlice object.
You can scale it freely — the borders will stay crisp, and only the center area will stretch.
