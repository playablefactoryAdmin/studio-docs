# Layout and Cell Components

import Image from "next/image";

Layout and Cell are used to create a grid-based layout system. They are tightly integrated with each other.

You can think of layout as a responsive container for cells. It automatically scales to the size of its parent. If you put it to the scene root, 
it will scale to the size of the screen. Every cell handles its children. 

Since every cell handles its children, you must think of the first cell as an another parent like layout. After selecting the first cell, 
you can add children cells to it and see how the layout will look in real time.

Now, let's look at the layout component in detail.

## Layout

### Landscape and Portrait 

Normally, landscape settings are used for both landscape and portrait. By selecting landscape here and overriding it, you can set different settings during landscape mode.

### Preview Window

In here, you can see the preview of the layout. You can also see the preview of the layout in the scene.

### Cell Button

Adds a cell as a children of this game object.

### Select Parent

### Delete Cell

### Order

Determines the stacking order of the cell relative to its siblings. For example, in a vertical stack of two cells, setting the first cell's order to `1` moves it below the second cell.

### Fraction

Specifies the proportion of space the cell occupies relative to its siblings. For instance, setting a cellâ€™s fraction to `0.3` allocates 30% of the available space to it, while the remaining 70% is distributed among the other cells.

### Contain Type

Defines the layout direction of the cell's children.

* `row`: Arranges child elements horizontally.
* `column`: Arranges child elements vertically.

### Mask

Applies a mask to the cell, controlling visibility and interaction within the layout.

### Z-Index

Specifies the rendering order on the z-axis, using the Pixi.js `zIndex` property. Higher values render above lower ones.
