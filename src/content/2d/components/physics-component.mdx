# Physics Component

Adds physical properties to objects using Box2D. This component controls how an object interacts in the physics simulation.

### Label

A custom identifier for the physics body. This is used for debugging and selection purposes.

---

### Body Type

Defines how the object behaves in the physics simulation:

* **Static** – Does not move and is unaffected by forces (e.g. ground, wall).
* **Dynamic** – Fully simulated: responds to gravity, collisions, and forces.
* **Kinematic** – Not affected by forces but can be moved manually.

Use the correct type depending on whether the object needs to move or just collide.

---

### Sensor

When enabled, the body detects collisions **without responding physically**.

Sensors are great for:

* Triggers
* Checkpoints
* Overlap zones

<Callout type="info">Sensors don’t block movement or cause bounces—they simply detect overlap.</Callout>

---

### Friction

Controls how much resistance the body has when sliding against another.

* **0** → Very slippery (ice-like)
* **1** → Very sticky (sandpaper-like)

Set this value based on how "grippy" the surface should feel.

---

### Restitution

Defines how **bouncy** the object is.

* **0** → No bounce (like clay)
* **1** → Maximum bounce (like a rubber ball)

---

### Density

Affects the **mass** of the body. Higher values make it heavier.

<Callout type="info">Only applies to dynamic bodies. Static and kinematic bodies ignore this.</Callout>

---

### Shape

Specifies the collision shape of the body (rectangle or circle).

This determines how the object interacts physically with others.

---

### Lock Body

Prevents the body from updating when the node’s transform changes (e.g. position, scale).

Enable this when:

* You want full control of the physics body manually
* The transform is being handled externally

---

### Offset

Applies an x/y offset to the collision shape **relative to the object origin**.

Useful when the shape should be slightly displaced from the visual object—for example, adding a "foot sensor" under a character.

---

### Shape Settings

The `GET SHAPE` button allows Studio to automatically calculate and apply the most appropriate shape properties for the selected Game Object. This is based on the object's current size, scale, and visual boundaries, and is used to optimize how it interacts within the Physics system.

You can also manually define the shape properties if you want to.
