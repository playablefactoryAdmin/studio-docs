<UserTable data={[
  { name: "Lifetime", desc: "Generates a random lifetime for each particle within a specified range. The left value is the minimum, and the right is the maximum." },
  { name: "Frequency", desc: "Controls how often particles are spawned. Use a very high number to effectively disable spawning." },
  { name: "Spawn Chance", desc: "Probability that a particle will be spawned when it's time to emit." },

### Alpha

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-alpha.png" alt="Particle Alpha" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

If both STATIC and Dynamic are set to true, STATIC will be overriden. 

#### Static

Directly set the alpha

#### Dynamic

Set the start, middle and end alpha values. You can think of this as points on a curve. Setting it to 0, 1 and 0 respectively will make alpha ease like a bell curve.

### Scale

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-scale.png" alt="Particle Scale" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

If both STATIC and Dynamic are set to true, STATIC will be overriden. 

#### Static

Randomly set the scale of the particle given min and max value range.

#### Dynamic

Set the start, middle and end alpha values. You can think of this as points on a curve. Setting it to 0, 1 and 0 respectively will make scale ease like a bell curve.

Min mult acts as a multiplier for all the values.

### Color

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-color.png" alt="Particle Color" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

If both STATIC and Dynamic are set to true, STATIC will be overriden. 

#### Static

Sets the color of the particle.

#### Dynamic

Set the start, middle and end alpha values. You can think of this as points on a curve. Setting it to 0, 1 and 0 respectively will make color ease like a bell curve.

### Move Acceleration

<UserTable data={[
  { name: "X", desc: "Set the direction of acceleration." },
  { name: "Min Start", desc: "Minimum random value for the direction (both axes)." },
  { name: "Max Start", desc: "Maximum random value for the direction (both axes)." },
  { name: "Rotate", desc: "Rotates the particle so that it faces the direction of acceleration." },
]} />

### Rotation

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-rotation.png" alt="Particle Color" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

If both STATIC and Dynamic are set to true, STATIC will be overriden. 

#### Static

Randomly set the rotation of the particle given min and max value range.

#### Dynamic

Using Min and Max Start values, set the start rotation of the particle. Min Speed and Max Speed are used to set the speed of the particle. 
Accel makes the particle rotate faster over time.

### Move Speed

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-move-speed.png" alt="Particle Move Speed" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

If both STATIC and Dynamic are set to true, STATIC will be overriden. 

This works in tandem with Move Acceleration. Set the direction of the acceleration and the speed of the particle will be set in here.

#### Static

Randomly set the rotation of the particle given min and max value range.

#### Dynamic

Set the start, middle and end alpha values. You can think of this as points on a curve. 
Setting it to 0, 1 and 0 respectively will make speed ease like a bell curve.

Min mult acts as a multiplier for all the values.

### Spawn Burst

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-spawn-burst.png" alt="Particle Spawn Burst" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

#### Spacing

Angle spacing between particles within the same wave, measured in degrees.

#### Start

Rotation to start spawning particles at (degrees)

#### Distance

Distance from emitter to particles.

### Blend Mode

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-blend-mode.png" alt="Particle Blend Mode" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

Sets the blend mode of the particles.

### Move Path

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-move-path.png" alt="Particle Move Path" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

Set the path of the particle, as a mathematical function.

Set the start, middle and end alpha values. You can think of this as points on a curve. 
Setting it to 0, 1 and 0 respectively will make speed ease like a bell curve.

Min mult acts as a multiplier for all the values.


### Spawn Shape

<Image src="/studio-docs/components/particle/particle-spawn-shape.png" alt="Particle Spawn Shape" width={500} height={500} className="pt-6" />

Set the spawn shape of the emitter. Only `rect` and `torus` are supported.
