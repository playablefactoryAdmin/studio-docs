This component is automatically added to all **Graphics** objects.

Use the **plus** button to add shapes to the graphics object. Multiple shapes can be combined within a single Graphics instance.

## Shape Settings

Each shape you add has its own set of configurable properties:

### Position

Defines the shape’s position relative to the graphics object’s origin.

The following settings are **shape-specific** and may vary depending on the selected shape type. Most are self-explanatory:

### Fill

Controls the fill of the shape.

* You can disable fill and enable stroke to create outline-only shapes (e.g., hollow rectangles).
* Fill supports **solid colors** or **gradients**. Use the **plus** button to define a gradient.

### Stroke

Configures the shape’s stroke (outline).

* Stroke settings mirror those of Fill and include color, width, and gradient options.
