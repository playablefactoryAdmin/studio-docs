# 2D Development Guide

Welcome to the 2D development guide for Studio! This section covers everything you need to know about creating 2D games and playable ads using Studio's powerful 2D engine.

## What is 2D Development in Studio?

Studio's 2D engine provides a comprehensive set of tools and components for creating:
- **2D Games**: Platformers, puzzle games, arcade games, and more
- **Playable Ads**: Interactive advertisements that engage users
- **Web Experiences**: Interactive web content and mini-games
- **Mobile Games**: Cross-platform 2D games for mobile devices

## Key Features

- **Sprite-based Rendering**: High-performance sprite rendering with support for animations
- **Physics System**: Built-in 2D physics for realistic interactions
- **Particle Effects**: Create stunning visual effects with the particle system
- **Layout System**: Responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes
- **Component Architecture**: Modular components for building complex interactions
- **Asset Management**: Efficient asset loading and management

## Best Practices

1. **Performance**: Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
2. **Memory Management**: Properly dispose of unused assets and textures
3. **Responsive Design**: Use the layout system for cross-device compatibility
4. **Asset Optimization**: Optimize textures and sprites for your target platforms
5. **Code Organization**: Use components to keep your code modular and reusable
